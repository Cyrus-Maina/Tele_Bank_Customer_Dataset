# Tele_Bank_Customer_Dataset

**BUSINESS INSIGHTS**

1. The age group 90-100 years has the largest average account balances. However, this is an outlier as it has only 5 customers.

2. Age groups 40-69 have the most customers, which may be a sign of higher disposable incomes/ saving culture and thus a good prospect for a variety of products

3. Most customers are aged 30-39, maybe as a result of decreased unemployment. They pose as a good source of a variety of products.

4. 49.5% of the customers are inactive. This may mean the bank is not operating at its full capacity. However, their average income is 112K,
   maybe a worthwhile investment to regain them.

5. Germany has the largest share of inactive accounts. Would be worthwhile to find out why to adjust

6.
